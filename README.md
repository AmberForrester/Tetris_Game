## About This Project
This game was built using Python as the programming language and it's Pygame library! Alongside the Pygame library, I was able to use it's various functions for the graphics, audio, and input handling for the Tetris game. 

Installing Pygame: 
```
pip install pygame-ce 
```

Receiving confirmation that it was successfully installed should render in your terminal:
```
Successfully installed pygame-ce-2.5.1 
```

Start using and initialize Pygame writing the following within `main.py`:
```
pygame.init()
```

## Set up the Game Structure  
Definitions:
- [ ] Defining the variables needed
- [ ] Creating the game objects 

Game Loop:
- [ ] Updating the positions of the game objects
- [ ] Checking for collisions 
- [ ] Consists of 3 steps: 

1. Event Handling -
    - Check for any events that occur in the game = quitting the game, a key pressed on the keyboard, etc. Using the Pygame event handling system. 

2. Updating Positions -
    - Update the positions of all the game objects (the blocks) based on the events we detected in Step 1 Event Handling. 

3. Drawing Objects -
    - Draw all the game objects in their new positions on the screen. Using the Pygame graphics functions to render the objects in the display. 

**By following 3 steps, we can create a dynamic and interactive game that responds to user inputs and updates its state accordingly.**


Game Window: (Display Surface) - 
    - Create the blank canvas to draw our game objects by using -> screen = pygame.display.set_mode((300, 600))
    - Set Mode method takes a tuple as an argument ((width, height))

Coordinate Systems to draw on the display surface - 
    - Computer Graphics - The origin of display is located at the top left corner (0, 0)
    - X Coordinate increases as we move to the RIGHT (X, 0)
    - Y Coordinate increases as we move DOWN (0, Y)

Set the Game Title using:
```
pygame.display.set_caption('Python Tetris Game')
```

Create a clock object using:
```
clock = pygame.time.Clock() 
```

**Make sure Clock has a capital C to control the frame rate of the game - _"How fast the game will run"_**
