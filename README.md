## About This Project
This game was built using Python as the programming language and its cross-platform set of modules Pygame, used to create video games! This partnership creates the perfect demonstration of a game development library with the various functions for graphics, audio, and input handling that Pygame has to offer. 
<br />
<br />
A good understanding of Python and Pygame would be beneficial to helping you create this project. However, it is always good practice to refer to the Documentation available when developing ***any*** project. 

_Please refer to the [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) and the [PyGame Documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) for your reference._

_The standard shell of Python, or REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) allows you to run Python code interactively as you work on a project or are in the process of learning this programming language. You may find it useful to vist the [Getting the Most Out of the Python Standard REPL website](https://realpython.com/python-repl/) to further your understanding and produce better results._

### Running the Game

1. **Ensure the Virtual Environment is activated** (You should see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt.)
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Tetris_Game.git
   cd Tetris_Game
   ```

2. **Start the Game**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **How to Navigate the Tetris pieces**
  - Left Arrow: Move left
  - Right Arrow: Move right
  - Down Arrow: Move down fast
  - Up Arrow: Rotate the piece, and Reset the game if you choose not to click "Play Again?"
